not going to get sucked into doing it for you like i did for AF yesterday, but just as a mock up of the UI...
to show you can put an image in your macro as base64
message
you'd just want to make it small
doing some research
instead of the image, you want a canvas, with the background set to the map
then you can draw circles on the canvas, with the map in the background
eg.
IMG1
you'll want a map file thats perfect scale of original map to make life easier
(not a graphics guy, and i suck at maths)

definitely stopping now
but confident can do everything you need
