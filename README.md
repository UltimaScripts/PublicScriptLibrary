# PublicScriptLibrary
This Repo is for scripts using ClassisAssist which are found, editted or wrote. <br>
It's main purpose is for Script Examples. <br>
Many scripts may be personalized for my own use. <br>
If you have trouble understanding these scripts, look up python tutorials or ask for help!

## Warning ##
Always be careful running other users scripts. ClassicAssist uses ironpython and can access files or even keystrokes. <br>
Always review a script in full to ensure it's not malicious. <br>
None of the scripts I added contain any malicious code, double check anyways!!
