# PublicScriptLibrary
This Repo is for scripts using ClassisAssist which are found, editted or wrote.

It's main purpose is for Script Examples.

Many scripts may be personalized for my own use.

If you have trouble understanding these scripts, look up python tutorials or ask for help!

## Warning ##
Always be careful running other users scripts. ClassicAssist uses ironpython and can access files or even keystrokes.

Always review a script in full to ensure it's not malicious.

None of the scripts I added contain any malicious code, double check anyways!!
